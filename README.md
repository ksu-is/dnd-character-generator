# dnd-character-generator
generates playable dungeons and dragons 5th edition characters

Program will take user input to generate a level 1 DnD character. The idea is to simply the character creation process for players new and old. 

DnD uses the word class to describe and group the core abilities of it characters. A DnD class always has a name such as "Fighter" or "Wizard". A Class is also the name for a key feature in python used to create objects. To avoid confusion in my documentation and comments I will use "Character Class" when I am referring to the DnD core feature, and I will use "Python Class" to describe the python functionality. 

I am creating my GUI elements using easygui https://github.com/robertlugg/easygui
Before running dnd character generator please install easygui by running "pip install easygui"
